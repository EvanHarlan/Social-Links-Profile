## Description
This HTML and CSS component allows you to create a social links profile with an interactive profile image and hover effects on tabs. It's fully responsive, providing a consistent experience across different devices.

## Usage
To use this component, follow these steps:

1. Copy the provided HTML code into your HTML file.
2. Link the provided CSS file (`style.css`) in the `<head>` section of your HTML file.
3. Replace the placeholder image (`profilepic.jpeg`) with your desired profile picture.
4. Customize the profile information and social links buttons as needed by editing the HTML code.

## HTML Structure
The HTML structure consists of two main sections within a container:
- `profile-picture`: Contains the profile picture, name, location, and job title.
- `button-card`: Contains the social links buttons.

## CSS Customization
The CSS file (`style.css`) contains custom styling for the component. You can customize the following aspects:
- Colors: Modify the color variables under `:root` to change the primary and neutral colors.
- Layout: Adjust the container size, padding, and margins to fit your design requirements.
- Profile Picture: Customize the size, border radius, and hover effect of the profile picture.
- Buttons: Modify the button styles, including background color, text color, padding, and border radius. Additionally, customize the hover effect for the buttons.

## Responsive Design
The component is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Media queries are used to adjust the container width and font sizes for smaller screens (max-width: 375px).
